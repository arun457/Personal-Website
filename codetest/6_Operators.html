          Pripyat (/ˈpriːpjət, ˈprɪp-/ PREE-pyət, PRIP-yət; Russian: При́пять), also known as Pryp'yat' or Prypiat
          (Ukrainian: При́пʼять, IPA: [ˈprɪpjɐtʲ]) is a ghost city in northern Ukraine, near the Ukraine–Belarus border.
          Named after the nearby river Pripyat, the town was founded on 4 February 1970, as the ninth "atomgrad", a type
          of closed town in the Soviet Union, to serve the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.[3] It was officially
          proclaimed a city in 1979 and had grown to a population of 49,360[4] by the time it was evacuated on the
          afternoon of 27 April 1986, the day after the Chernobyl disaster.[5]

          Although Pripyat is located within the administrative district of Vyshhorod Raion (prior to the 2020 raion
          reform Ivankiv Raion) the abandoned municipality now has the status of city of oblast significance within the
          larger Kyiv Oblast (province) and is administered directly from Kyiv. Pripyat is also supervised by Ukraine's
          Ministry of Emergencies, which manages activities for the entire Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

          Access to Pripyat, unlike cities of military importance, was not restricted before the disaster, as the Soviet
          Union deemed nuclear power stations safer than other types of power plants. Nuclear power stations were
          presented as achievements of Soviet engineering, harnessing nuclear power for peaceful projects. The slogan
          "peaceful atom" (Russian: мирный атом, romanized: mirnyy atom) was popular during those times. The original
          plan had been to build the plant only 25 km (16 mi) from Kyiv, but the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, among
          other bodies, expressed concern that would be too close to the city. As a result, the power station and
          Pripyat[6] were built at their current locations, about 100 km (62 mi) from Kyiv. After the disaster, the city
          of Pripyat was evacuated in two days.[7]

          Pripyat amusement park, as seen from the City Center Gymnasium

          The Azure Swimming Pool was still in use by liquidators in 1996, a decade after the Chernobyl incident.

          In 2009, over two decades after the Chernobyl incident, the Azure Swimming Pool shows decay after years of
          disuse.
          In 1986, the city of Slavutych was constructed to replace Pripyat. After the city of Chernobyl, this was the
          second-largest city for accommodating power plant workers and scientists in the Commonwealth of Independent
          States (CIS).

          One notable landmark often featured in photographs of the city and visible from aerial-imaging websites is the
          long-abandoned Ferris wheel located in the Pripyat amusement park, which had been scheduled to have its
          official opening five days after the disaster, in time for May Day celebrations.[8][9] The Azure Swimming Pool
          and Avanhard Stadium are two other popular tourist sites.

          On 4 February 2020, former residents of Pripyat gathered in the abandoned city to celebrate the 50th
          anniversary of Pripyat's establishment. This was the first time former residents returned to the city since
          its abandonment back in 1986.[10]

          During the 2020 Chernobyl Exclusion Zone wildfires, the flames reached the outskirts of the town; they did not
          reach the plant.[citation needed]

          Infrastructure and statistics

          Pripyat before the Chernobyl disaster, 1983
          The following statistics are from 1 January 1986.[11]

          Population: 49,400 before the disaster. The average age was about 26 years old. Total living space was 658,700

          reactors (plus two more planned).
          Transportation: Yanov railway station, 167 urban buses, plus the nuclear power plant car park with 400 spaces.
          Telecommunication: 2,926 local phones managed by the Pripyat Phone Company, plus 1,950 phones owned by
          Chernobyl power station's administration, Jupiter plant, and Department of Architecture and Urban Development.

          Pripyat 2007
          A concern is whether it is safe to visit Pripyat and its surroundings. The Zone of Alienation is considered
          relatively safe to visit, and several Ukrainian companies offer guided tours around the
          area.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] In most places within the city, the level of radiation does not
          exceed an equivalent dose of 1 μSv (one microsievert) per hour.[21]

          Climate
          The climate of Pripyat is designated as Dfb (Warm-summer humid continental climate) on the Köppen Climate
          Classification System.[22]

          terminus of Semikhody, built in 1988 and located in front of the nuclear plant, is currently the only
